# bitmap-transformer
## About
For this assignment you will be building a bitmap (.bmp) transformer CLI. It will read a bitmap in from disk, run one or more color or raster transforms and then write it out to a new file. This project will require manipulating binary data. Your solution should be composed of small tested methods that solve specific problems. Your methods should be thoughtfully named and well documented. You should run ./gradlew run --args 'input output transform' to run your application. Your bitmap transformer modules should not use any third party libraries.
